## Overview
Data and code used for paper titled "Risk Assessment Predicts Final Product Standards Most Specifically Targeting Products with High-Level of Highly-Prevalent High-Virulence Serotypes Most Efficiently Reduce Public Health Risk from Salmonella in Comminuted Turkey" can be found here. 

In 2024, USDA-FSIS published risk assessments evaluating the impact of final product standards considering Salmonella contamination >10 CFU/g with 1 of 3 highly-prevalent, high-virulence serotypes adulterant in raw poultry products. We adapted our previous risk assessment for chicken parts, incorporating critical assumptions from FSIS risk assessments, to evaluate final product standards with different criteria for comminuted turkey. We simulated (1) Salmonella contamination level and serotype distribution generated from HACCP sampling data for comminuted turkey; (2) Salmonella level change from final product to consumption adjusted by an attenuation distribution and a scaling factor; (3) the risk of illnesses per serving using serotype-specific dose-response model updated with genomics-based virulence clustering of serotypes; and (4) the attributable fraction of salmonellosis illnesses from products with certain levels and/or serotypes. Using the inputs from most recent data, 87% of illnesses are attributed to the 0.56% of products with Salmonella >10 CFU/g. Considering specific serotypes, 60% of illnesses are attributed to 0.14% of products with Salmonella >10 CFU/g of the three most prevalent high-virulence serotypes. Applying criteria of more specific genomics-based Salmonella contamination captures more risks in slightly more products (75% of illnesses in 0.19% of products with Salmonella >10 CFU/g). However, levels “OR” serotypes criteria, compared to levels “AND” serotypes criteria, capture more illnesses in many more products (99% of illnesses in 5.7% of products with Salmonella >10 CFU/g). Our study demonstrated that most salmonellosis risk is concentrated in comminuted turkey products contaminated with high-levels of high-virulence strains. Importantly, more specifically targeting those products can efficiently protect public health while minimizing products implicated.
